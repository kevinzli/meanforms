<h2>BOILER INSTALLATION PERMIT AND PIPING DESIGN REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<ol>
	<li>No boiler installation permits are required for:
		<ol>
			<li>Any pressure vessel</li>
			<li>Power plant with a boiler or assembly of boilers which has a total heating surface area of 2 m2 or less</li>
			<li>Any heating or low pressure thermal fluid plant with a boiler or assembly of boilers which has a total heating surface area of 3 m2 or less</li>
			<li>A heating plant that has no valves or other obstruction to prevent circulation of fluid between the boiler and an expansion tank that is fully vented to the atmosphere </li>
			<li>A heating plant with a boiler or assembly of boilers other than plants with toxic or flammable contents that are located in a building that contains only 4 or fewer self-contained residential units</li>
			<li>Any potable water heater with a heat input of 120 kW (400,000 Btu/hr.) or less</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
