<h2>BOILER INSTALLATION PERMIT AND PIPING DESIGN REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS</h2>
1) No boiler installation permits are required for:
a) Any pressure vessel
b) Power plant with a boiler or assembly of boilers which has a total heating surface area of 2 m2 or less
c) Any heating or low pressure thermal fluid plant with a boiler or assembly of boilers which has a total heating surface area of 3 m2 or less
d) A heating plant that has no valves or other obstruction to prevent circulation of fluid between the boiler and an expansion tank that is fully vented to
the atmosphere
e) A heating plant with a boiler or assembly of boilers other than plants with toxic or flammable contents that are located in a building that contains
only 4 or fewer self-contained residential units
f) Any potable water heater with a heat input of 120 kW (400,000 Btu/hr.) or less
2) Boiler installation permits are required when any of the limits listed below are exceeded:
a) Power plant with a boiler or assembly of boilers which has a total heating surface area more than 2 m2
b) Any heating or low pressure thermal fluid plant with a boiler or assembly of boilers which has a total heating surface area more than 3 m2
c) Any power plant, heating or low pressure thermal plant, or potable hot water boiler located in a building that contains more than 4 self -contained
residential units
d) Any potable water heater with a heat input more than 120 kW (400,000 Btu/hr.)
3) Boiler installation permits Terms & Conditions:
 All installations must be performed by a Licensed Boiler Contractor
 Contractor is to notify the area Boiler Safety Officer prior to commencement of any regulated work
 Contractor, when ready for inspection, is to submit to BCSA form FRM-1149-00 (2013-04-15 "Boiler, Pressure Vessel and Refrigeration
Inspection Declaration" / http://www.safetyauthority.ca/sites/default/files/boiler_and_refrigeration_inspection_declaration_frm-1149.pdf
4) Piping design registration are required for:
● Any Power Plant with a boiler or assembly of boilers which has a total heating surface area more than 2 m2 and piping system greater than NPS 3
a) Permits for boiler plants which require piping design registration are issued at the BC Safety Authority Head office only
b) Permits for boiler plant installations which do not require piping design registration may be issued at any BC Safety Authority regional office

Definitions (as described in the Safety Standards Act & Regulations):
 Power Plant: High pressure steam plant or high pressure thermal fluid plant or a high temperature high pressure fluid plant.
 High pressure Thermal Fluid Plant: All thermal fluid plants except low pressure thermal fluid plant.
 High Temperature High Pressure Fluid Plant: In which liquid is heated to a temperature greater than 121°C (250°F); or liquid is contained at a
pressure greater than 1 103 kPa (160 Psig).
 Low Temperature Low Pressure Fluid Plant: In which liquid is heated at a working pressure of 206 kPa (30 Psig) or less and a temperature of
98.9°C (210°F) or less.
 Heating Plant:
a) a boiler in which steam or other vapour may be generated at a pressure not exceeding 103 kPa (15 Psig), or
b) a boiler, other than a low-temperature, low-pressure boiler, in which water or an aqueous solution may be heated to a pressure not exceeding
1 103 kPa (160 Psig) or a temperature not exceeding 121°C (250°F)
 Water Heater: Potable hot water at pressures not exceeding 1103 kPa (160 Psig) or temperature not exceeding 98.9°C (210°F)
 High Pressure Steam: Steam pressure greater than 103 kPa (15 Psig)
 Low Pressure Steam: Steam pressure not more than 103 kPa (15 psig)
